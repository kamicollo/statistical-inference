This repository contains 2 short reports required for Statistical Inference class at Coursera (https://class.coursera.org/statinference-010). I put these materials for archiving purposes and to demonstrate my R skills. Please do not reuse them for your own homework solutions - I'm sure you can do better than I've done!
